Backupninja Module
-------------------

Configure Backupninja handlers via Puppet.

Simply include backupninja (to make sure you've got the package installed)
then configure backupninja:

backupninja::config { conf:
	loglvl => 3,
	usecolors => false
}

And setup your handlers:

backupninja::mysql { all_databases:
	user => root,
	backupdir => '/var/backups',
	compress => true,
	sqldump => true
}

backupninja::rdiff { backup_all:
	directory => '/media/backupdisk',
	include => ['/var/backups', '/home', '/var/lib/dpkg/status'],
	exclude => '/home/*/.gnupg'
}

A remote rdiff backup handler:

    backupninja::rdiff { "main":
        host => "backup.example.com",
        type => "remote",
        directory => "/backup/$fqdn",
        user => "backup-$hostname",
    }

If you configure a backupninja::server, it will collect those users and create
them.  We have yet to create proper authorized_keys management to make that
process completely automatic.

At the moment, only the mysql and rdiff handlers have types defined for
them, as they're the only handlers we currently use at Solutions First. 
Writing others is fairly simple; feel free to contribute them, or ask really
nicely and we might have a bit a free time.
