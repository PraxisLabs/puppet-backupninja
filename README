Backupninja Module
-------------------

Configure Backupninja handlers via Puppet.

Simply include backupninja (to make sure you've got the package installed)
then configure backupninja:

backupninja::config { conf:
	loglvl => 3,
	usecolors => false
}

And setup your handlers:

backupninja::mysql { all_databases:
	user => root,
	backupdir => '/var/backups',
	compress => true,
	sqldump => true
}

backupninja::rdiff { backup_all:
	directory => '/media/backupdisk',
	include => ['/var/backups', '/home', '/var/lib/dpkg/status'],
	exclude => '/home/*/.gnupg'
}

At the moment, only the mysql and rdiff handlers have types defined for
them, as they're the only handlers we currently use at Solutions First. 
Writing others is fairly simple; feel free to contribute them, or ask really
nicely and we might have a bit a free time.
